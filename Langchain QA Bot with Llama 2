Data Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its raw form, without any predefined schema or structure. This allows for greater flexibility in storing and processing different types of data.

Data Processing: A data lakehouse provides more flexible and scalable data processing capabilities compared to a data warehouse. Since it doesn't have a fixed schema, data can be processed using various algorithms and techniques, such as machine learning, data mining, or stream processing. In contrast, a data warehouse typically uses SQL-based query languages to process structured data.\n","4.

Cost: A data lakehouse can be more cost-effective than a data warehouse, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data.

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores data in a structured manner, typically for querying and analysis. A data lakehouse, on the other hand, is a storage system that allows for flexible schema design and supports multiple data sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\\n\\nIn this article, we will explore the key differences between these two concepts and help you determine which one best fits your organization's needs.\\n\\nKey Differences Between Data Lakehouse and Data Warehouse:\\n\\n1. Structure: A data warehouse stores data in a rigidly defined structure, with well-defined tables, columns, and relationships. In contrast, a data lakehouse has a flexible schema that can adapt to changing data sources and structures.\\n2. Data Types: A data warehouse typically stores structured data, such as relational databases, while a data lakehouse can store various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\\n3. Scalability: Data lakehouses are designed to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally, making them ideal for big data analytics. Data warehouses, on the other hand, can become bottlenecked as the volume of data grows.\\n4. Querying: Data warehouses are optimized for complex queries and provide fast query performance due to their pre-defined schema. Data lakehouses, however, offer more flexibility in terms of querying, allowing for ad-hoc queries and real-time analytics.\\n5. Security: Data warehouses typically have robust security features, such as access controls and encryption, to protect sensitive data. Data lakehouses may not have the same level of security features, especially if they are not properly configured.\\n6. Cost: Data warehouses tend to be more expensive than data lakehouses due to their rigid structure and pre-defined schema. Data lakehouses, on the other hand, offer cost savings by storing data in its raw form and avoiding the need for extensive data transformation.\\n7. Use Cases: Data warehouses are commonly used for reporting,
